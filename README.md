# OneTweet :point_up::bird:

In class we used AI (Illustrator) to create typography posters using first tweets form influential twitter accounts. My chosen tweet is shown below,

> @edballs - Ed Balls

Ed Balls was part of the Labour Uk party and went to Harvard University. I am playing on the fact that he went to such a highly praised Uni and still managed to tweet his name. I have an idea to use the Harvard Uniâ€™s font to create the poster.

![Poster 1] 

So reading this article I saw that this tweet had been shared over 14,000 times so my second variation of my poster I decided to repeat the tweet over and over to show how many times it had been retweeted. So I decided to also use the twitter colours for this so I searched up the offical Hex Codes for the colours they use in the branding of twitter which I found here.

I ended up designing 3 posters around the Ed Balls tweet and 2 over another tweet.
