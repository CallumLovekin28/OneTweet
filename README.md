# OneTweet :point_up::bird:

In class we used AI (Illustrator) to create typography posters using first tweets form influential twitter accounts. My chosen tweet is shown below,

> @edballs - _Ed Balls_

Ed Balls was part of the Labour Uk party and went to Harvard University. I am playing on the fact that he went to such a highly praised Uni and still managed to tweet his name. I have an idea to use the Harvard Uniâ€™s font to create the poster. I understand that at first glance you might not understand what the poster means but a lot of thought went behind the design process.

So reading this article I saw that this tweet had been shared over 14,000 times so my second variation of my poster I decided to repeat the tweet over and over to show how many times it had been retweeted. So I decided to also use the twitter colours for this so I searched up the offical Hex Codes for the colours they use in the branding of twitter which I found [here].(http://designpieces.com/2012/12/twitter-colour-palette/) The other twitter poster where the tweet is repeated over and over again kind of follows the same princible as the fact its been retweeted 14,000 times, but also shows how many peoples twitter it has been on and how many eyes have seen it.

I then changed tweet and decided to design 2 posters around the tweet by Jack.

> @Jack - _just setting up my twtter_

My first poster is simple as it is just the tweet and a faded I as that is missing from the word twitter. The second poster alot more thought went into it and as it was one of the first tweets I thought I would find a different "First" in another industry. The idea behind it was that pong was the first game that took off and I think that in its industry it was a game changer (Pardon the pun) And Twitter is also the biggest name in the social network industry.
