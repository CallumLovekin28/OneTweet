# OneTweet :point_up::bird:

In class we used AI (Illustrator) to create typography posters using first tweets form influential twitter accounts. My chosen tweet is shown below,

> @edballs - _Ed Balls_

Ed Balls was part of the Labour Uk party and went to Harvard University. I am playing on the fact that he went to such a highly praised Uni and still managed to tweet his name. I have an idea to use the Harvard Uniâ€™s font to create the poster.

So reading this article I saw that this tweet had been shared over 14,000 times so my second variation of my poster I decided to repeat the tweet over and over to show how many times it had been retweeted. So I decided to also use the twitter colours for this so I searched up the offical Hex Codes for the colours they use in the branding of twitter which I found here.

I then changed tweet and decided to design 2 posters around the tweet by Jack

> @Jack - _just setting up my twtter_

My first poster is simple as it is just the tweet and a faded I as that is missing from the word twitter. The second poster alot more thought went into it and as it was one of the first tweets I thought I would find a different "First" in another industry.
